# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

I'm Uttam, a mechatronics engineer who loves building things that move, think, and solve real problems. This portfolio is where I share the projects I've worked on, the things I've learned, and hopefully, what makes me excited about engineering.

## What you'll find here

I work across a few different areas that interest me:

**Robotics & Hardware**  
Building physical systems that interact with the world. From underwater robots that competed internationally to 3D-printed grippers that can handle delicate objects.

**AI & Machine Learning**  
Teaching computers to recognize patterns and make predictions. I've built chatbots, analyzed climate data, and created models for environmental monitoring.

**Embedded Systems & IoT**  
Making devices smarter and connected. Whether it's a training system for kids with special needs or motor controllers that provide real-time feedback.

**Software Development**  
Apps and web tools that bring it all together. Because hardware is only half the story.

## Some projects I'm proud of

**Training system for kids with ASD** (2025)  
Built a resistive pedal trainer that therapists can monitor and adjust remotely. Uses ESP32 and Raspberry Pi to track progress and provide feedback. It's rewarding work that actually helps people.

**Underwater robot for competitions** (2023-2025)  
Spent two years with a team building an autonomous underwater vehicle. We competed in Abu Dhabi and placed 4th globally. Lots of late nights debugging control systems, but totally worth it.

**ROS2 robot with LiDAR mapping**  
Created a three-wheeled bot that can map its environment and navigate autonomously. It's basically a smaller, friendlier version of what goes into self-driving cars.

**Climate pattern analysis**  
Used K-Means clustering to find patterns in weather data. Sometimes the best insights come from letting algorithms do what they do best.

**Soft gripper design**  
Designed and 3D-printed a gripper that's gentle enough for fragile objects. It's inspired by soft robotics research and made with accessible FDM printing.

## What I work with

**Languages:** Python, C++, C, SQL, Embedded C, Rust, R programming  
**Robotics:** ROS2, microcontrollers, sensors, control systems  
**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn  
**Tools:** Git, MATLAB, Fusion 360, Docker, Linux  
**Hardware:** STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, various sensors

## Currently

Working as an R&D Embedded Engineer at Nosh Robotics in Bengaluru, where I'm developing control systems for robotic applications. It's exciting to work on problems that push what's possible with embedded hardware.

## Background

Graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology with a degree in Mechatronics. Took courses in everything from embedded systems to machine learning, soft robotics to digital signal processing. The interdisciplinary nature is what drew me to this field.
